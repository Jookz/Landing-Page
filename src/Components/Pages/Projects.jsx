        <p>
          NC-News is a simulated news platform, designed with a backend API that
          enables programmatic access to application data, and a front end that
          allows the user to easily and effectively use it. The primary goal is
          to replicate the structure of a real-world backend service, similar to
          platforms like Reddit, furnishing essential information to the
          front-end architecture. This project serves as a demonstration,
          showcasing the mechanisms involved in creating a functional backend
          that delivers data to a front-end interface.
